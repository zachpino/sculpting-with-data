### Design Sprint : Improving Fitness

-----

Having played with a family of analog and digital sensors, let's do some hypothetical designing!

How might we collect data about user behaviors, and create a new data-driven product/service/experience/platform in one of these (hopefully familiar) specific fitness categories?

- Racket Sports
- Weight Training
- Rock Climbing
- Swimming or Diving
- Ballroom Dance
- Yoga 
- Jogging
- Bicycling
- Beach Volleyball
- Canoeing or Kayaking

What promises could such an offering make? In what object or environment might the sensors live? Is the product educational? Performance measuring and tracking? Performance improving and visualizing? Does it help in training or in competition? Safety and health focused? Does it encourage motivation and perseverence? Structure games and teamwork? 

Do a few sketches!
