### Sculpting with Data Workshop : Algorithmic Design

-----

The collected data from the morning will become the raw material for contemporary algorithmic design tools, which participants will use in the afternoon to directly sculpt products and envision inclusive interactions and services that are hyper-customized to specific users. Discussions about emerging resources in digital fabrication, the overlap between contemporary form design and data visualization, remote data collection techniques, and applications for machine learning in design will be included alongside case-studies from the realms of architecture and urban-planning â€” where hyper-customization is already being tested at large scales. Participants will leave the workshop having designed a thing that in turn designs an infinite variety of other things, enabling every potential user to have an experience that is fundamentally designed for them. This workshop can taken either with Sculpting with Data: Data Collection or independently.
