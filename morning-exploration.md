### Sensor Exploration and Data Collection

-----

Digital and analog sensors are affordable, accessible, and reliable tools for creating an embedded, computational awareness of the world. A huge variety of sensors exists for capturing all sorts of environmental, physical, and human phenomena. Sensors can be readily combined with one another to generate richer data.

##### RGB Color Sensor

The [TCS34725 RGB Color Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-Color-Sensor-filter-White/dp/B00OKCRU5M/) shoots out white light and measures the wavelength intensity of the light that bounces back â€” returning red, green, and blue values.

##### 9DOF Motion Sensor

The [LSM9DS1 9DOF Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-9-DOF-Accel-Breakout-Board/dp/B06XH5Y6DC/) measures linear and rotational acceleration, temperature, and the Earth's magnetic field to measure relative and absolute motion in three dimensions.
