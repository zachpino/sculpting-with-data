### Morning Workshop

-----

8:30	Morning Agenda (and install Arduino, Rhinoceros Evaluation)
8:40	Icebreaker
			What kind of data is collected by their employer, or at their home?
8:45	Slide Deck
			Data's Place in the Design Process: Very Beginning and Very End
			Data as Aggregate and Relational, not Data as Individual
			Craft -> Modernism -> Open Design -> PostModernism -> Universal Design -> Mass Customization
			Intersectional Intersections
			Languaging -> Algorithmic, Parametric, Machine Learning...
			Aspirational Examples
				Sensor-Enabled Data Collection
				Sensor as Object / Interactive Spaces
				User Input Data Collection
				Environmental Data Collection
				Ergonomics, Fit, Function, Material
			Transformation from Product to Service to Data Platform Model

9:15	Sensor Variety / Microcontroller Introduction
9:30	Sensor Exploration (Groups of 2 Playing with Sensors)
			Sensors: 9DOF/6DOF, Flex Sensor, Color, Shadow, Pressure/Force, Rangefinder, Audio Volume, Something Environmental (whatever I have at school!)
10:15	Group Exercise: Using these example sensors, how could we collect data to refine a product/service/experience in specific fitness product categories? 
11:00	Visualizing the Data -> Grasshopper Demo (visualize motion line from 9dof? see light/shadow over time? flex topography? Visualize rangefinder matrix? whatever there is time for...)
