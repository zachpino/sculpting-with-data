### Sculpting with Data Workshop : Measuring the World

-----

Hyper-customized products and services — designed so that each user receives an experience scoped uniquely to them — is at last becoming a viable approach in physical product and service design. In this hands-on workshop, students will explore how the collection of data on individual users can be integrated into every aspect of the design process — not only in insight discovery and process streamlining, but also in the direct shaping of final products and experiences. The morning workshop will include a hands-on tutorial on how various sensors can be implemented, combined, and deployed to measure human intentionality and biomechanics. Participants will collect live data samples from themselves and their environment, and use contemporary data exploration tools to discover trends, patterns, and insights. This workshop can be taken either with Sculpting with Data: Algorithmic Design or independently.
